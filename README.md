![Senators](senators.png)
<addr> This graph illustrates the partisan breakdown of our Senate. Currently, the majority of our Senators are Republican and only two members of the Senate are Independent. If we analyze the data by gender, we find that there is a siginificant difference between how many female and male Senators are in each party. The Democratic party has the highest female representation in the Senate and the Indepedent party has the least.

## India's Population
![India's populations](india_pop.png)
<addr> This graph illustrates the total population in India since 1960s to 2019. Data for 2020 has not been collected at this point. However, India's population seems to have a steady increase (almost linear) over this time period. The graph indicates there might be a very slight decrease in the rate of increase as the population count approaches 2020.
